This project presents an end-to-end Tableau dashboard built on the Superstore dataset to explore and analyze sales and profit performance. The dashboard goes beyond static charts by offering interactive KPIs, filters, and drill-down options that enable users to uncover meaningful business insights.

It covers analysis across years, regions, product categories, and customer segments, allowing users to:

Track overall sales, profit, and order trends.

Identify profitable and loss-making categories/sub-categories.

Compare regional performance and highlight growth opportunities.

Monitor year-over-year progress using bar charts and line charts.

Visualize sales contribution by category and region through maps and pie charts.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data visualization can transform raw business data into actionable insights, making it a strong portfolio project for data analytics.
